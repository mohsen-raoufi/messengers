## Overview

In the paper, we introduce the messengers method as a solution to break echo chambers in collective opinion dynamics within homophilic networks in spatial information space. This repository provides all necessary codes to replicate our study, including simulation, post-processing, and visualization scripts.

## Contents

- **Simulation Codes**: Scripts to run the simulations demonstrating the method with an agent-based model.
- **Post-Processing Scripts**: Code for analyzing the simulation results.
- **Visualization Tools**: Scripts to generate visual representations of the simulation outcomes, including animations.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
